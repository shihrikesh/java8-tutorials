   /* Write a program that takes as input a sequence of transactions of the form "buy x; share(s) at $y each"
    or "sell x share(s) at $y each," assuming that the transactions occur on consecutive days and
    the values x and y are integers. Given this input sequence, the output should be the total
    capital gain (or loss) for the entire sequence, using the FIFO protocol to identify shares.
            example, suppose we buy 100 shares at $20 each on day 1, 20 shares at $24 on day 2,
            200 shares at $36 on day 3, and then sell 150 shares on day 4 at $30 each. Then applying
    the FIFO protocol means that of the 150 shares sold, 100 were bought on day 1, 20
    were bought on day 2, and 30 were bought on day 3. The capital gain in this case would
    therefore be 100 · 10 + 20 · 6 + 30 · (−6), or $940*/

    // Share  Busy Sell
    // Share unit , price, day

    // buy 100 shares at $20 each on day 1

 //head =day
 //share (unit, price)
}
